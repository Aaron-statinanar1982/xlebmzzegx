# Costuming-The-Electric-State

A Reflective History from the Wardrobe Department

---

## ✨ Project Overview ✨

Working on the film adaptation of Simon Stålenhag's The Electric State was unlike any project I've encountered in my decades as a costumer. Stålenhag's art isn't just illustration; it's a haunting, atmospheric narrative woven into the very fabric of its post-apocalyptic American landscape. Bringing that world, and particularly its inhabitants, to life through clothing was a profound undertaking.

This isn't a world of sleek, futuristic jumpsuits or dramatic, tattered rags designed purely for shock value. It's a world where everyday life – or what's left of it – collides with the colossal, enigmatic presence of the robots and the decay of a recent past. Our approach had to reflect this intimate yet vast desolation. It was about telling quiet stories through worn threads, faded colours, and accumulated history.

## 🧵 The Philosophy: Every Stitch Tells a Story 🧵

My core philosophy for The Electric State was authenticity through wear and tear. In a world where resources are scarce and the journey is paramount, clothing isn't just protection; it's a record. It shows where you've been, what you've endured, and the memories you carry, often literally patched onto your sleeve.

> The greatest challenge, and the most rewarding part, was making everything look like it had a real past. Not just dirt and rips, but the specific, personal history of a journey across a broken world.

We aimed for layers – physical layers against the elements, and emotional layers representing the character's journey. Nothing was new. Everything had lived a life before the story began, and would continue to accumulate its history on screen.

## 👥 Character Studies: Fabric of Their Being 👥

### Michelle: The Weight of the Journey

Michelle's costume was perhaps the most critical. She is our guide through this world. Her clothing needed to be practical, allowing for movement, but also deeply personal.

   Layers: We built her look from the base up. Simple, worn underlayers, practical trousers or sturdy jeans (repaired many times), and crucially, her jacket. The jacket became her shell, her protector, a repository of dust from forgotten roads and stains from meals eaten on the run.
   Colour Palette: Muted, earth tones, deliberately faded by sun and weather. Nothing vibrant remains. Colours are ghosts of what they once were.
   Distressing: This wasn't just distressing; it was intentional history. A patch where a hole was, indicating resourcefulness. Scuff marks on boots telling of miles walked. Fading lines showing where a backpack or strap constantly rubbed. The fabric itself had to look tired, reflecting Michelle's own exhaustion and resilience. It had to feel heavy, the way her journey feels heavy.

### Skip: The Patina of Time and Purpose

Costuming a robot is a unique challenge. Skip doesn't wear clothes, but his exterior is his costume. It tells his story just as vividly as Michelle's jacket tells hers.

   Surface Detail: We focused on the patina of existence. Not just rust, but layers of it. Dents and scratches that suggested specific encounters. Dust and grime that spoke of the terrain he'd traversed.
   Repair and Modification: Just as humans patch clothes, a robot in this world would be repaired. Visible welds, mismatched panels, replaced parts – these are Skip's patches, his history of damage and continuation.
   Texture: The difference in texture between aged metal, worn rubber hoses, and perhaps salvaged components created a visual language for his construction and his journey alongside Michelle. His surface had to feel as authentic and lived-in as her clothes.

## 🌎 World-Building Through Wardrobe 🌎

Beyond the main characters, the world needed to feel cohesive.

   Scavenged Variety: The people encountered would wear whatever they could find. This allowed for a rich tapestry of mismatched items, clothes that were too big or too small, and creative repurposing of materials. A blanket turned into a cloak, salvaged workwear, faded remnants of pre-collapse fashion.
   Factional Hints: Any groups or settlements might show subtle uniformities – a shared colour, a specific type of patch, but still rooted in resourcefulness, not military precision.
   Environmental Impact: Costumes were constantly adapted to the specific environments of the film – dusty plains, overgrown ruins, damp shelters. This meant varying levels of dirt, moisture, and decay.

## ✨ The Process: Weaving Reality into Fabric ✨

Our process involved deep dives into the practicalities of survival. What materials would last? How would someone truly repair something with limited tools? We used natural fabrics that age beautifully – cotton, wool, denim, canvas.

Techniques included:

   Layered Dyeing and Fading: Creating depth and the look of uneven sun exposure.
   Intensive Distressing: Using sandpaper, wires brushes, tearing, and chemical washes, but always with a narrative purpose behind the damage.
   Hand Patching and Mending: Every patch was considered – the type of fabric used, the quality of the stitching, reflecting the skill and resources of the character.
   Adding Authentic Grime: Special washes and powders to simulate dirt, dust, and sweat stains that looked like they belonged, not just applied.

It was often a messy, hands-on process, getting the costumes themselves to feel like artifacts.

## ❤️ The Touching Connection ❤️

The most touching aspect was seeing the actors inhabit these worn garments. When an actor puts on a jacket that feels heavy with simulated history, or pulls on boots that look like they've walked a thousand miles, something shifts. They connect with the character's struggle on a tactile level.

There were moments on set, watching Michelle in her faded layers against the backdrop of a giant, silent robot, where the clothing simply disappeared, and you just saw a person, on a difficult journey, visually grounded in her reality by what she wore. That's when you know you've done your job – when the costume doesn't stand out, but makes the character stand firmly in their world.

This project wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about empathy. Creating these costumes was an act of imagining the lives lived in this strange, beautiful, melancholic world. It was an honour to help bring that history to life.
